Build a 3D brick visualizer using React Three Fiber. The user selects brick dimensions and color, then sees the brick rendered in 3D with slow auto-rotation. Brick geometry specs: BRICK_UNIT = 1 (1 stud = 1 world unit), BRICK_HEIGHT = 0.96 (slightly less than 1 unit), STUD_RADIUS = 0.24, STUD_HEIGHT = 0.17. The main body is a box with dimensions (width * BRICK_UNIT) x BRICK_HEIGHT x (depth * BRICK_UNIT), positioned with bottom at Y=0 so center is at Y = BRICK_HEIGHT / 2. Studs are cylinders placed on top in a grid pattern, one per grid cell. Stud center Y position is BRICK_HEIGHT + STUD_HEIGHT / 2. For stud X/Z positions, loop through x from 0 to width-1 and z from 0 to depth-1, calculating studX = (x - (width - 1) / 2) * BRICK_UNIT and studZ = (z - (depth - 1) / 2) * BRICK_UNIT. Use meshStandardMaterial with the selected color. White background. Ambient light intensity 0.6 plus a directional light. OrbitControls with autoRotate true and autoRotateSpeed 2. Camera at isometric angle like position [4, 3, 4]. No grid or baseplate, just the floating brick.
